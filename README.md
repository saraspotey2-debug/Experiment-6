# Experiment-6
# Aim
Study of Conditional Statements in python.
# Theory
1. Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution of a program. They allow the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code based on conditions.
2. Conditional statements- Conditional statements check whether a condition is True or False and execute code accordingly.In Python, the main conditional statements are: if, if-else, if-elif-else and nested if.
3. If statement- The if statement executes a block of code only if the condition is True.
4. If-else- It executes one block if the condition is True and another block if it is False.
5. Else- The else statement in Python is used with conditional statements to define a block of code that runs when the condition in the if (or elif) statement is False.
6. Elif statement- The elif statement in Python stands for “else if”. It is used to check multiple conditions one after another.When the first if condition is False, Python checks the elif condition. If that is also False, it continues checking the next elif, and so on.
7. Logical Operators in Conditions-and → True if both conditions are True,or → True if at least one condition is True and not → Reverses the result.
8. Comparison Operators Used are- ==	Equal to, !=	Not equal, >	Greater than, <	Less than, >=	Greater than or equal and <=	Less than or equal.
9. Nested if statement- An if inside another if.
10. Indentation in Python-In Python, indentation (spaces before code) is very important.It defines the block of code under a condition.
11. Split- In Python, split() is a string method used to break a string into smaller parts (substrings) based on a separator.
# Algorithm-6.1 
1. Start.
2. To take input(num) from user.
3. To print positive if num>0 using if statement.
4. To print negative for num<0 using else if statement.
5. To print zero for num=0 using else statement.
6. End.
# Algorithm-6.2
1. Start.
2. To take input(num) from the user.
3. To print even if the num is divisible by 2 using if statement.
4. To print odd if the num is not divisible by 2 using else statement.
5. End.
# Algorithm-6.3
1. Start
2. To take input from the user a,b and c.
3. To print a is the largest if a>b and a>c using if statement.
4. To print b is the largest if b>c and b>a using elif statement.
5. To print c is the largest using else statement.
6. End.
# Algorithm-6.4
1. Start.
2. To take input(marks) from the user.
3. To print Grade A if marks>=90 using if statement.
4. To print Grade B if marks>=75 using elif statement.
5. To print Grade C if marks>=60 using elif statement.
6. To print Grade D if marks>=40 using elif statement.
7. Else print Grade F using else statement.
8. End.
# Algorithm-6.6
1. Start.
2. To take the input(year) from the user.
3. To print leap Year if year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100 using if statement.
4. Else print Not a Leap Year using else statement. 
5. End.
# Algorithm-6.7 
1. Start.
2. To take the input of date from the user in the format of dd/mm/yyyy.
3. To split the input string into three parts using split and /.
4. Converting dd, mm and yy into integer using int.
5. To find maximum days in month using if statement which sets maximum days as 31.
6. To check if month has 30 days and sets maximum days as 30 using elif statement.
7. To check if the year is a leap year using elif statement or using else statement if it has 28 days only.
8. To print Date is invalid using if statement if month other than 1-12.
9. To print Date is invalid using elif statement if date less than 1 and greater then max1.
10. To print the incremented date using elif and else statement.
11. End.
# Algorithm- 6.8
1. Start
2. To take input from the user.
3. To print Vowel if vowel in ch using if statement.
4. Else print Consonant using else statement.
5. End.
# Algorithm- 6.9
1. Start.
2. To take the input from the user.
3. If basic<=10000 then calculates hra and da using if statement.
4. If basic<=20000 then calculates hra and da using elif statement.
5. Else calculates hra and da using else statement.
6. To calculate gross by the formula.
7. To print the gross salary.
8. End.
# Algorithm- 6.10
1. Start
2. To take the input from the user.
3. If income<=250000 then no tax added using if statement.
4. If income<=50000 then 5 percent tax added using elif statement.
5. If income<=1000000 then 20 percent tax added using elif statement.
6. Else 30 percent tax added using else statement.
7. To display the result.
8. End.
# Conclusion 
Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in Python programming. They help the program to make decisions based on conditions, making the code dynamic and intelligent.
